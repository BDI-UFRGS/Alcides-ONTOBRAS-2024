generically dependent continuant;dsra rna;dsra rna regulates both transcription, by overcoming transcriptional silencing by the nucleoid-associated h-ns protein, and translation, by promoting efficient translation of the stress sigma factor, rpos. these two activities of dsra can be separated by mutation: the first of three stem-loops of the 85 nucleotide rna is necessary for rpos translation but not for anti-h-ns action, while the second stem-loop is essential for antisilencing and less critical for rpos translation. the third stem-loop, which behaves as a transcription terminator, can be substituted by the trp transcription terminator without loss of either dsra function. the sequence of the first stem-loop of dsra is complementary with the upstream leader portion of rpos messenger rna, suggesting that pairing of dsra with the rpos message might be important for translational regulation.
