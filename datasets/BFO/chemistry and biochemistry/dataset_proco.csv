generically dependent continuant;reaction progress kinetic analysis;kinetic techniques utilized to determine the rate laws of chemical reactions and to aid in elucidation of reaction mechanisms. while the concepts guiding reaction progress kinetic analysis are not new, the process was formalized by professor donna blackmond (currently at scripps research institute) in the late 1990s and has since seen increasingly widespread use. unlike more common pseudo-first-order analysis, in which an overwhelming excess of one or more reagents is used relative to a species of interest, rpka probes reactions at synthetically relevant conditions (i.e. with concentrations and reagent ratios resembling those used in the reaction when not exploring the rate law.) generally, this analysis involves a system in which the concentrations of multiple reactants are changing measurably over the course of the reaction. as the mechanism can vary depending on the relative and absolute concentrations of the species involved, this approach obtains results that are much more representative of reaction behavior under commonly utilized conditions than do traditional tactics. furthermore, information obtained by observation of the reaction over time may provide insight regarding unexpected behavior such as induction periods, catalyst deactivation, or changes in mechanism.
