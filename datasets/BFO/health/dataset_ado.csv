generically dependent continuant;beta-secretase 1 measurement;quantification of the amount of beta-secretase 1 in a sample, typicallly cerebrospinal fluid. beta-secretase-1 is an aspartic-acid protease important in the formation of myelin sheaths in peripheral nerve cells, and is thought to have a role in alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
process;middle-stage alzheimer's disease (moderate);a disease in the middle stage where the dementia symptoms are more pronounced. the person may confuse words, get frustrated or angry, and act in unexpected ways, such as refusing to bathe. damage to nerve cells in the brain can also make it difficult for the person to express thoughts and perform routine tasks without assistance.
