process;disease surveillance;a planned process that is the realization of a disease surveillance objective specification.
process;facultative ectosymbiotic mutualism;an ectosymbiotic mutualism that realizes some facultative mutualist role inhering in an organism that is also realized by a bodily benefit to that organism.
process;potentially infectious contacting;a biological process that brings the organism into sufficiently close physical proximity to a pathogen population, either in or on a contaminated thing or an infectious host, such that the organism is likely but not certain to acquire an infection with the pathogen.
process;agent-level ecosystem data generation;a planned process that has one or more synthetic ecosystem datasets as output.
process;obligatory ectosymbiotic parasitism;an ectosymbiotic parasitism that realizes a biological function that inheres in some proper part of the parasite.
process;ectosymbiotic parasitism;an intimate agonism in which the harm is not fatal to the host.
process;obligatory ectosymbiotic commensalism;an ectosymbiotic commensalism that realizes a biological function that inheres in some proper part of the commensal organism that benefits.
process;obligatory ectosymbiotic parasitoidism;an ectosymbiotic parasitoidism that realizes a biological function that inheres in some proper part of the parasitoid.
process;grazing;a non-intimate agonism in which the harm is not fatal.
process;fulminant period;a temporal part of a disease course that 1) itself has a temporal part of becoming severely symptomatic, 2) terminates in either death or some bodily harm, and 3) has a sudden onset and short duration.
process;obligatory endosymbiotic parasitism;an endosymbiotic parasitism that realizes a biological function that inheres in some proper part of the parasite.
process;infection acquisition;the biological process of pathogen organism(s) of a particular biological taxon entering (the tissues of the body of) a host organism of another taxon from a contagious host or a contaminated thing and reproducing using host resources
process;endosymbiotic commensalism;an endosymbiosis that results in benefit to one participating organism and neither harm nor benefit to the other participating organisms.
process;vaccination efficacy study design execution;a study design execution that has as its specified output one or more measured vaccination efficacy data items
process;becoming severely symptomatic;the process of an organism beginning to experience severe symptoms caused by a disease.
process;colonization;a reproduction of a pathogen of a particular biological taxon inside a host organism of another taxon, without invasion of the tissues of the host.
process;prospective infectious disease forecast;an infectious disease forecast that has specified input some data set, the data items of which are about an infection in ecosystem that is current concomitant with the forecasting software s executable code being realized.
process;data parsing;a data transformation that has a dataset, encoded in a particular data format specification, as input and extracts certain elements or parts of the dataset, typically into the volatile memory of a computer.
process;contamination acquisition;a biological process whereby an entity that is not in contact with a pathogen of a particular biological taxon begins to undergo contamination with that pathogen.
process;facultative ectosymbiotic parasitoidism;an ectosymbiotic parasitoidism that realizes some facultative parasitoid role inhering in an organism that is also realized by a bodily benefit to that organism.
process;incubation period;a process that is part of an infectious disease course, has the same beginning temporal boundary as the disease course, and has an ending temporal boundary at the onset of symptoms due to the infectious disease.
process;facility survey;a planned process involving counting numbers of facilities in a specific region.
process;infection acquistion from self colonization;an infection acquisition by which a pathogen organism from a particular biological taxon, which previously was participating in a colonization process in a host organism from another taxon, begins to invade the tissues of the same host organism and reproduce there.
process;infectious disease forecast;a planned process that realizes some infectious disease forecasting software.
process;wolbachia effect on adult mortality rate in mosquito population;a process of change in the adult mortality rate of a mosquito population that is the outcome of an infection in that population by a wolbachia bacteria population.
process;bodily harm;a process that has as output a material entity that is the material basis for an abnormal homeostasis dispostion.
process;wolbachia effect on larval mortality rate in mosquito population;a process of change in the larval mortality rate of a mosquito population that is the outcome of an infection in that population by a wolbachia bacteria population.
process;case series;an investigation that realizes the concretization of some disease state design and that has as an occurrent part some population survey that has specified input some case definition.
process;population infection survey;a population survey that counts the number of individuals in the population who are infected with a particular pathogen.
