specifically dependent continuant;contributor role;a role borne by a person, group, organization, or information processing entity (e.g. software, algorithms) in virtue of its active participation in a process leading to some outcome (e.g the generation, modification, or provision of some entity).
generically dependent continuant;statement;an information content entity expressing a declarative sentence that is either true or false.

generically dependent continuant;study data set;a data set comprised of data items produced by a single research study.
generically dependent continuant;confidence level;a data item that quantifies the level of confidence an agent has that a particular piece of information is true.
generically dependent continuant;assertion;a statement made by a particular agent on a particular occasion that a particular proposition is true, based on the evaluation of one or more lines of evidence.
generically dependent continuant;evidence line;an evidence line represents an independent and meaningful argument for or against a particular proposition, that is based on the interpretation of one or more pieces of information as evidence.

generically dependent continuant;evidence strength;a data item that quantifies the degree of support an agent believes an evidence line to provide for a particular proposition.
generically dependent continuant;assertion method;a directive information entity that specifies an algorithm or heuristics for evaluating evidence in the process of making an assertion.
generically dependent continuant;evidence direction;a data item that indicates an agent's assessment of whether an evidence line supports or disputes a target proposition (or represents inconclusive evidence that is not sufficient for either).
generically dependent continuant;evidence quality;a data item that indicates the quality of the data used as evidence by an agent making an assertion.
generically dependent continuant;study finding;a statement describing the immediate results of a research study, describing what was directly observed, measured, or derived through mathematical calculation.
