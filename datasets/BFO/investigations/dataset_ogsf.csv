independent continuant;genetic susceptibility factor;a genetic material that is the material base of genetic susceptibility
independent continuant;susceptibility allele;genetic susceptibility factor that is an allele
independent continuant;susceptibility allele of snp;genetic susceptibility factor that is a simple nucleotide polymorphism (snp).
independent continuant;susceptibility gene;genetic susceptibility factor that is a gene
independent continuant;susceptibility genotype;genetic susceptibility factor that is a genotype
independent continuant;susceptibility haplotype;genetic susceptibility factor that is a haplotype
specifically dependent continuant;genetic susceptibility to biological process;a genetic susceptibility that lead to the increased possibilities to initiate a biological process in an organism, whose genome has related genetic susceptibility factor (he physical basis of this genetic susceptibility) as its part.
specifically dependent continuant;genetic susceptibility to drug adverse event;a genetic susceptibility to adverse event that is proceded by a drug administration
specifically dependent continuant;genetic susceptibility;a disposition that is physically based on some genetic material, such as one or more gene mutations or variant, such that if the genome of an organism has the genetic material as its part, the organism may have an increased likelihood or chance to develop: 1) a particular disease. 2) a peculiar biological/bodily process.
specifically dependent continuant;genetic susceptibility to adverse event;a genetic susceptibility that lead to the increased possibilities to initiate adverse event in an organism, whose genome has related genetic susceptibility factor (he physical basis of this genetic susceptibility) as its part.
specifically dependent continuant;genetic susceptibility to multiple scelorosis ae following pandemix vaccination;a genetic susceptibility to adverse event that is proceded by a vaccination process.
specifically dependent continuant;genetic susceptibility to pathological bodily process;a genetic susceptibility that lead to the increased possibilities to initiate a patholoical bodily process in the organism, whose genome has related genetic susceptibility factor (he physical basis of this genetic susceptibility) as its part.
specifically dependent continuant;genetic susceptibility to vaccine adverse event;a genetic susceptibility to adverse event that is proceded by a vaccination process.
specifically dependent continuant;genetic susceptibility to adverse event following pandemix vaccination;a genetic susceptibility to adverse event that is proceded by a vaccination process.
generically dependent continuant;negative conclusion of genetic susceptibility;the textual conclusion from the paper that mentioned the genetic susceptibility of a genetic susceptibility factors that is denied by statistical calculation. 
generically dependent continuant;positive conclusion of genetic susceptibility;the textual conclusion from the paper that mentioned the genetic susceptibility of the genetic susceptibility factors that is statistically meaningful (statistically supported).
generically dependent continuant;neutral conclusion of genetic susceptibility;the textual conclusion from the paper that mentioned the genetic susceptibility of a genetic susceptibility factors is neither deny nor support by statistical calculation.
process;case control genetic association study;genetic association investigation that use to observe the non-random differences of a genetic factor's frequency between case group and control group.
process;initial gwas study;the first genome wide association study that conducted in a population to observe the genetic association with a phenotype or trait.
process;genetic association investigation;investigation that aims to test whether single-locus alleles or genotype frequencies (or more generally, multilocus haplotype frequencies) differ between two groups of individuals (usually diseased subjects and healthy controls). genetic association studies are based on the principle that genotypes can be compared "directly", i.e. with the sequences of the actual genomes.
process;replicate gwas study;the gwas study that intend to repeat initial gwas study's observation over a different population using a different design and methods by different investigation teams.
