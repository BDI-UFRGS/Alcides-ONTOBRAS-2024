independent continuant;liquid chromatography valve;a sample valve that must be able to sustain pressures up to 10,000 p.s.i., although it is most likely to operate on a continuous basis, at pressures of 3,000 p.s.i. or less. the higher the operating pressure the tighter the valve seating surfaces must be forced together to eliminate any leak. it follows that any abrasive material, however fine, that passes into the valve can cause the valve seating to become scored each time it is rotated which will ultimately lead to leaks. this will cause the sample size to vary between samples and eventually affect the accuracy of the analysis. it follows that any solid material must be carefully removed from any sample before filling the valve. the sample volume of an internal loop valve is situated in the connecting slot of the valve rotor and can be used only for relatively small sample volumes. internal sample loop valves provide samples with volumes ranging from 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml. valve operation is shown in figure 6. the left-hand side diagram shows the load position. the sample occupies the rotor slot and has been filled by passing the sample from an appropriate syringe through the rotor slot to waste. while loading the sample, the mobile phase supply is passed through the valve directly to the column. to place the sample onto the column, the valve is then rotated and the valve slot containing the sample is now placed between the solvent supply and the column. as a result, the sample is passed into the column by the flow of solvent.

independent continuant;vacuum degasser;a degassing system used for degassing solvents in liquid chromatography. dissolved gasses, usually nitrogen and oxygen from the air, tend to be evolved in the mobile phase as the pressure is reduced when the mobile phase leaves the liquid chromatography column and enters the detector. gasses in the mobile phase in the detector can produce completely unacceptable noise and, thus, must be removed. the dissolved gasses were originally removed under vacuum but, unfortunately, are soon replaced if the solvent is left in contact with air at atmospheric pressure. for this reason degassing is now usually carried out by bubbling helium through the mobile phase reservoirs. secondly, vacuum is used in the thermionic detector. this consists of a device, very similar in design to the thermionic valve which is attached to a vacuum and a small quantity of the eluent from a gas chromatography column allowed to bleed through it. helium is used as the carrier gas. the presence of solute vapor causes the thermionic current to fall. this type of detector tends to become contaminated rather readily.

independent continuant;nitrogen phosphorous detector;the nitrogen phosphorus detector (npd) (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive, specific detector the design of which, is based on the fid. physically the sensor appears to be very similar to the fid but, in fact, operates on an entirely different principle. the nitrogen phosphorous detector (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive but specific detector that responds almost exclusively to nitrogen and phosphorous compounds. it is based on the flame ionization detector but differs in that it contains a rubidium or cesium silicate (glass) bead situated in a heater coil, a little distance from the hydrogen flame. if the detector is to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorous then the hydrogen flow should be minimal so that the gas does not ignite at the jet. if the detector is to respond to phosphorous only, a large flow of hydrogen is used which is burnt at the jet. the heated bead emits electrons by thermionic emission. these electrons are collected under a potential of a few volts by an appropriately placed anode, and provides a background current. when a solute containing nitrogen or phosphorous is eluted from the column, the partially combusted nitrogen and phosphorous materials are adsorbed on the surface of the bead. the adsorbed material reduces the work function of the surface and, as consequence, the emission of electrons is increased which raises the current collected at the electrode. the sensitivity of the detector to phosphorous is about 10-12 gram per ml and for nitrogen about 10-11 gram per ml at a signal to nose ratio of 2. the alkali bead as a finite life and needs regular replacement.
