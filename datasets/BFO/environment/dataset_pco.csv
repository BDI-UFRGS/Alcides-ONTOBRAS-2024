process;population process;a process that has as primary participant a population. includes processes such as population growth, extinction, evolution, selection, and adaptation. population processes may depend on the processes of individual organisms {e.g., population growth reflects the cumulative multicellular organism reproduction (go:0032504) and death (go:0016265) of all individuals in a population}, but cannot be described for an individual organism. some of these processes (e.g., evolution, extinction) can also occur at the species level, so pco distinguishes between, for example, population extinction and species extinction.
