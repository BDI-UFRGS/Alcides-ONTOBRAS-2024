independent continuant;european food groups (efg);the european food groups (efg) classification system was developed, as a project of cost action 99/eurofoods, in an attempt to evaluate the level of food description and classification that would permit international comparisons of the results of available food consumption and food availability surveys. in order to formulate the efg system, several classification schemes used for recording food intake at the international and national classification schemes were compared: international - fao food balance sheet, who gems/foods regional diets, dafne classification system for household budget survey (hbs) data, and eurocode 2 core classification (levels 1 and 2). national - french national food consumption survey (1999), dutch national food consumption survey (1998), and british national food survey. in the process of comparing food intake data from various european countries, it became evident that such comparisons are feasible only when results are expressed at the raw ingredient level. since the dafne classification system groups food items at the raw level, it was one of the international classification schemes used to create the efg food grouping system. ref.: ireland, j., van erp-baart, a.m.j., charrondi re, u.r., m ller, a., smithers, g., and trichopoulou, a.: selection of food classification system and food composition database for future food consumption surveys. european journal of clinical nutrition, 56, suppl. 2, s33 - s45, 2002.

independent continuant;045 crustaceans (wc) (ccpr);crustaceans are aquatic animals of various species, wild or cultivated, which have an inedible chitinous outer shell. a small number of species live in fresh water but most species live in brackish water and/or in the sea. exposure to pesticides is through animal metabolism or water pollution. crustaceans are prepared for wholesale or retail distribution at a "raw" stage, often still alive, "raw" and deep-frozen or cooked directly after catching and deep-frozen. shrimps or prawns may also be parboiled and thereafter deep-frozen. although the cooked or parboiled crustaceans should be regarded as processed foods, the animals of this group are primarily classified in the chapter on primary food commodities, type 8: aquatic animal products, since several crustaceans are also-marketed in a "raw" form, i.e. not exposed to temperatures sufficiently high to coagulate the protein at the surface. a short reference to processed crustaceans is given in type 17: derived edible products of animal origin, group 084 crustaceans, processed. the entire commodity except the shell may be consumed: the "raw" commodities, in general, after cooking. in some countries, species such as the norway lobster (nephrops norvegicus) are included in the commodity "prawns" with some qualifying designation, such as dublin bay prawn or prawn of bantry bay (both ireland).the codex stan. 92-1981 on quick frozen shrimps and prawns does not prevent this practice, provided that the designation on the label ensures that the consumer will not be misled. there is no clear-cut distinction between shrimps and prawns. in several countries the commodity name-shrimps is used for the small species whereas the slightly larger ones are called prawns. however, a species marked in certain regions of the world as "prawn" may be called in the local english language in other areas a shrimp and visa versa, e.g., pandalus borcalis is called northern prawn or deepwater prawn in the united kingdom and the same species is named pink shrimp in canada. in australia only the name prawn is used for animals included in this commodity. not including the freshwater species of the palaemonidae.
