process;wilcoxon signed-rank test;an inferential statistical data analysis used when comparing two related samples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ (i.e. it is a paired difference test). it can be used as an alternative to the paired student's t-test, t-test for matched pairs, or the t-test for dependent samples when the population cannot be assumed to be normally distributed.

process;knuth shuffle;a random permutation process that generates a permutation of n items uniformly at random without retries. specifically, it is to start with any permutation (for example, the identity permutation), and then go through the positions 1 through n 1, and for each position i swap the element currently there with a randomly chosen element from positions i through n, inclusive.

process;friedman test;a special case of the durbin test that was proposed by milton frieman and is applicable to complete block designs. friedman test detects the differences in treatments across multiple test attempts. the procedure involves ranking each row (or block) together, then considering the values of ranks by columns.
process;nonlinear regression;a form of regression analysis in which observational data are modeled by a function which is a nonlinear combination of the model parameters and depends on one or more independent variables
process;mcnemar's test;a normal approximation used on nominal data. applied to 2x2 contingency tables to determine whether the row and column marginal frequencies are equal ("marginal homogeneity").

process;gene set enrichment analysis;an inferential statistical data analysis that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (e.g. phenotypes).
process;robust multi-array average normalization;a normalization data transformation that used to create normalized gene expression level from microarray raw data. the raw intensity values are background corrected, log2 transformed and then quantile normalized in the rma normalization process. 
process;power calculation;a data transformation that is used to calculate the power of a statistical analysis.
process;data collection from survey;a data collection by sampling process that results in a collection of data generated from an survey(s).

process;anscombe transformation;a variance-stabilizing transformation that transforms a random variable with a poisson distribution into one with an approximately standard gaussian distribution.
process;yates' chi-squared test;a chi square test that is used in certain situations when testing for independence in a contingency table. in some cases, yates' correction may adjust too far, and so its current use is limited.
