independent continuant;cydippid larva;a ctenophore larva
independent continuant;ciliated groove;a groove that runs along the surface of the animal to each of the eight ctene rows
independent continuant;colloblast;a specialized adhesive cell found in ctenophores
independent continuant;mesoglea;a thick jelly-like layer between the epidermis and gastrodermis. the mesoglea is mostly acellular and composed of extracellular matrix, but it also has some muscle and mesenchymal cells.
independent continuant;quadrant;one of of four nearly identical quadrants organized along the oral-aboral axis. each of the four quadrants is derived largely from one cell of the four-cell-stage embryo. at the eight-cell stage each quadrant contains a single e ("end") and m ("middle") blastomere. subsequently, micromeres are formed first at the aboral pole and later at the oral pole.
independent continuant;oral lobe;a conspicuous lobed structure used for feeding, characteristic of the lobata ("sea walnuts")
independent continuant;stellate mesenchymal cell;a multipolar mesenchymal cell found in the stellate mesenchyme. may be phagocytic. absent in derivatives of 2m? macromeres.
independent continuant;parietal muscle;ribbon-shaped smooth muscle that resides between the glandular epithelial cells and the basal lamina
independent continuant;photocyte;light-producing cell present in nearly all ctenophores
independent continuant;meridional canal;a canal that is associated with a testis and an ovary
independent continuant;ctenophore pharynx;an ectodermal structure which connects the mouth to the endodermal component of the gut, deep inside the animal
independent continuant;lithocyte;a mineralized cell generated and constantly replaced in the floor of the apical organ. they are supported on top of the balancing cilia that make up the gravity-sensing statocyst of the apical organ.
independent continuant;ctene plate;a collection of cilia attached to basal cushions and made up of polster cells. a characteristic feature of ctenophores
independent continuant;polar field;an ectodermal structure emanating from the apical organ along the esophageal axis.
independent continuant;trans-tentacular muscle;a muscle that connects the two tentacle apparatuses
independent continuant;ctene row;a row that is composed of individual ctene plates, which are arranged in longitudinal rows parallel to the oral aboral axis
