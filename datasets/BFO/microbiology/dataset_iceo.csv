specifically dependent continuant;recombination directionality factor gene role;a role played by a gene that encodes products for controlling the directionality of integrase-mediated site-specific recombination reactions.
specifically dependent continuant;type iv coupling protein role;a role played by a protein which links translocating substrates to the transenvelope secretion conduit.
specifically dependent continuant;integration and excision module component role;a role played by a material entity that contributes to the integration and excision of the element from the host chromosome.
specifically dependent continuant;relaxase gene role;a role played by a gene that encodes a protein for nicking the dsdna.
specifically dependent continuant;conjugation module component role;a role played by a material entity that often involves in the conjugal process.
specifically dependent continuant;origin of transfer role;a role played by a material entity that contains a conserved nick region (flanking the nic site) and variable numbers of inverted repeats (irs) and served as origin site of transfer.
specifically dependent continuant;recombination attachment site role;a role played by a short dna sequence that recombinases recognize, bind to and then cleave the dna backbone, exchange the two dna helices involved and rejoin the dna strands.
specifically dependent continuant;type iv secretion system gene component role;a role played by a gene that encodes a protein which is part of t4ss (a cell envelope-spanning complexes that form a channel through which dna and proteins can travel from the cytoplasm of the donor cell to the cytoplasm of the recipient cell. )
specifically dependent continuant;integrase gene role;a role played by a gene that encodes products to mediate an exchange reaction between two dna templates and result in integration of dna from one of the templates into the other.
specifically dependent continuant;integrase role;a role played by a protein that mediates an exchange reaction between two dna templates and results in integration of dna from one of the templates into the other.
specifically dependent continuant;t4ss atpase role;a role played by a protein that energizes the t4ss system from the cytoplasm and drives the complex assembly and substrate translocation through the channel.
